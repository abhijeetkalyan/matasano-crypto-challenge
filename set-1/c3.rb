Single-byte XOR cipher

The hex encoded string:

1b37373331363f78151b7f2b783431333d78397828372d363c78373e783a393b3736

... has been XOR'd against a single character. Find the key, decrypt the message.

You can do this by hand. But don't: write code to do it for you.

How? Devise some method for "scoring" a piece of English plaintext. Character frequency is a good metric. Evaluate each output and choose the one with the best score.

#Scores a piece of plaintext based on the 'ETAOIN SRHDLU' frequency table. This approach multiplies each letter by its frequency
#value found in the following table: http://www.math.cornell.edu/~mec/2003-2004/cryptography/subs/frequencies.html. (This is not
#the ideal method though, as 'eeeeeeeeeeee' would get a higher score than any real sentence of the same length, but is suitable
#for this problem).
